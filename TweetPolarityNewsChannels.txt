Following are the three trends that I notice in the "news channel sentiment analysis using twitter" assignment:

1) BBC and CBS received positive tweets where as CNN, FOX and New York Times received negative tweets as of March 27th 2018.

2)Many tweets received for all the news channels are neutral and fall on 0.0 polarity line on the sentiment analysis chart.

3)There is a spike in positive emotions for CBS. It receives very high number of positive tweets and CNN received the smallest number of negative tweets as of March 27th 2018.
